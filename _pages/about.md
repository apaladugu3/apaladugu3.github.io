I am a post-doctoral scholar in the Integrated Systems Engineering department at the Ohio State University (OSU). My research interests include but are not limited to creating and demonstrating tools that help evaluate distributed work systems. This includes research on using computational modeling and simulation techniques for evaluating envisioned safety critical systems. This research can be applied to a variety of domains of practice, such as low altitude short range air transportations system, spaceflight operations, large scale software system and disaster response operations.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
