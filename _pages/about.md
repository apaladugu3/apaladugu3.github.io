I am a post-doctoral scholar in the Integrated Systems Engineering department at the Ohio State University (OSU). My research interests include but are not limited to creating and demonstrating tools that help evaluate distributed work systems. This includes research on using computational modeling and simulation techniques for evaluating envisioned safety critical systems. This research can be applied to a variety of domains of practice, such as low altitude short range air transportations system, spaceflight operations, large scale software system and disaster response operations.
