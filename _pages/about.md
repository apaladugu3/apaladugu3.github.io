I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Integrated Systems Engineering department at The Ohio State University. My work focuses on developing computational modeling and simulation tools to evaluate distributed work systems, especially those operating in complex, safety-critical environments. I’m interested in understanding how new technologies and automation affect system-wide performance under both ideal and degraded conditions.

My research spans domains such as low-altitude air mobility, spaceflight operations, large-scale software systems, and disaster response. At its core, my work enables designers, engineers, and decision-makers to anticipate how new capabilities interact with human operators, automation, and the broader system. This approach reveals trade-offs, coordination needs, and potential failure modes before systems are fully built or deployed.

For industry, this means being able to evaluate the downstream effects of a change. Whether you're planning to overhaul incident response protocols, migrate workflows to a new platform like Salesforce, or place a multi-million dollar aircraft order, my approach helps organizations proactively identify performance gaps, coordination breakdowns, or unintended consequences introduced by new procedures or technologies. The goal is to provide actionable insight before high-stakes decisions are made, saving time, reducing risk, and ensuring a smoother transition to future-ready operations.

By modeling work and how it interacts with the work environment, I help provide a different perspective that will bridge the gap between system design and real-world operation. My goal is to provide tools that support informed decision-making in early-stage development, ensuring that future autonomous and semi-autonomous systems are not only innovative but also resilient, scalable, and human-aware.
