**Alternate Architectures for Air Mobility Contingency Management**  
*Sept. 2022 – June 2025*  
**Technologies:** C++, Python

- Modeled alternate architectures or alternate distributions of authority and responsibility.
- Case study of an envisioned Dallas Forth Worth airspace to evaluate the alternate architectures.
- Computationally modeled and simulated the case studies for alternate architectures and analyzed the output for emergent properties like coordination and overall workload.
- Evaluated alternate architectures and created visualizations (graphs and networks) to show tradeoffs, like high information exchange vs. faster contingency detection.
- Some of the results of this work are published in the Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making (JCEDM). https://doi.org/10.1177/15553434251327698
