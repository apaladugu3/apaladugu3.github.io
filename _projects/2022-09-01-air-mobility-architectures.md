excerpt: |
  - Modeled alternate architectures or alternate distributions of authority and responsibility.
  - Case study of an envisioned Dallas Forth Worth airspace to evaluate the alternate architectures.
  - Computationally modeled and simulated the case studies for alternate architectures and analyzed the output for emergent properties like coordination and overall workload.
  - Evaluated alternate architectures and created visualizations (graphs and networks) to show tradeoffs, like high information exchange vs. faster contingency detection.
