**Computational Modeling of Coordination Strategies**  
*Aug. 2021 – Jan. 2022*  
**Technologies:** C++, Python

- Computational modeling of different human-machine coordination strategies spread over a spectrum between fully explicit and implicit coordination.
- Simulated the computational models to evaluate the strategies in an envisioned unmanned aircraft systems contingency scenario.
- The results of this work are published in the Journal of Aerospace Information Systems (JAIS). https://doi.org/10.2514/1.I011239
