**Cognitive Systems Engineering to Support Anomaly Response in Space**  
*Sept. 2024 – present*  
**Technologies:** C++, Python, VenSim

- Modeling and simulating micrometeorite showers on Smart Habitats to discover and gather more information for designers.
- Case study of an envisioned Smart Habitat based on documentation from NASA.
- Modeling the heat and energy dynamics in VenSim for determining equilibrium.
- Computationally modeled and simulated the case study using models of physics for heat and other life support systems.
- Next step is to create a set of metrics that can communicate patterns of interaction in the envisioned space anomaly response.
