excerpt: |
  - Modeling and simulating micrometeorite showers on Smart Habitats to discover and gather more information for designers.
  - Case study of an envisioned Smart Habitat based on documentation from NASA.
  - Modeling the heat and energy dynamics in VenSim for determining equilibrium.
  - Computationally model and simulate the case study using models of physics for heat and other life support systems.
  - The next step is further modeling of the actions to complete the simulations to show a proof of concept.
