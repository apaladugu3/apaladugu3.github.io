title: "NASA STTR I: Cognitive Systems Engineering to Support Anomaly Response in Space"
collection: projects
date: 2024-09-01
venue: "Technologies Used: C++, Python, VenSim"
location: "Sept. 2024 â€“ present"
excerpt: |
  - Modeling and simulating micrometeorite showers on Smart Habitats to discover and gather more information for designers.
  - Case study of an envisioned Smart Habitat based on documentation from NASA.
  - Modeling the heat and energy dynamics in VenSim for determining equilibrium.
  - Computationally modeled and simulated the case study using models of physics for heat and other life support systems.
  - Next step is to create a set of metrics that can communicate patterns of interaction in the envisioned space anomaly response.
